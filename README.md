#A text editor for markdown#
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timurtu/markdown-text-editor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/timurtu/markdown-text-editor)

**(Name is subject to change)**

**UPDATE 2** I have decided to continue this project because [MdNote](http://md-note.com/) was not what I had in mind. This text editor is meant for ANYONE to use so markdown is abstracted as you are writing with a WYSIWYG editor, but you will still be able to switch tabs to see and edit the markdown code being produced. When you're finished you can save it anywhere you want. The app will start with a tutorial.

**UPDATE** I just found out that [MdNote](http://md-note.com/) exists, so I have discontinued this project unless there are significant differences between the two apps.

Developers aren't the only people using markdown for writing documents. This application makes writing markdown accessible to everyone.
