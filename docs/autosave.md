Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself](http://www.reddit.com).

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into
links. http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

    var s = 'JavaScript syntax highlighting';
    alert(s);

### Python

    s = "Python syntax highlighting"
    print s
